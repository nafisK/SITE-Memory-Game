# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Nafis Khan**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tiles-codepath?path=script.js%3A89%3A18

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [X] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here: 
[Youtube.com, Stackoverflow.com, W3schools.com]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I have been coding for about a year, but it has been a very up and down journey. The projects I did were for college courses related to understanding the basics and the concepts of programming. This pre-work has given me a very simple but yet extremely clear and concise introduction to web development. I am much less scared by it now, than I was a couple of months ago. 
 I always wondered how programmers made games from simple lines of code, turn data into audio, programmed hardware to do things, etc. In the last month, I realized that it is by connecting a lot of different parts and making them all work perfectly. As I am learning more about different frameworks, libraries, and programming in general, I am realizing how complicated it can get fast and how well I need to understand a topic to get the best and most efficient output.
 Before this project, I knew of a couple of basic things from Codepathâ€™s Android Course, such as using buttons, styling texts, etc. but the use of sound was completely new to me. Understanding sound and how it works forced me to learn a little about a lot of different topics. When I learn something, I like to dive in deep so that I have a general idea of what I am doing exactly. I try to learn more than necessary, to get ideas from work done by other people, and then apply my own to my projects. So, when trying to learn and apply sounds, I realized how many things went into making a sound. I learned a lot about frequency, gain and pitch, and it showed me how math went into making a sound. There are still a lot of things that I do not understand, such as where the conversion from data to sound happens after the geometric calculations, etc. but I will look into it more during spring break. Instead of copy-pasting the code from the pre-work website, I tried to understand every step and then code it. Understanding how the frequency, gain, and what the oscillator function is and was the hardest part of this project. And I am glad I did it because now I will be able to implement them in the future.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After getting an idea for how things come together, how HTML provided the structure, CSS gave the look and JavaScript made everything interactable, I really want to know how so many interactions are managed, especially for websites like Twitter and Facebook. How to try new libraries without harming the previous code? How do I make the website look exactly like I want to for every single user? How does a website and an app share a database for them to talk with each other? And, how someone would be able to make a game for the web and the way approach they would have to take for it.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would try to make it look a little nicer and the logic better. The user would be stopped from pressing any buttons when the pattern is being played and an option for different sounds for the tiles would make the website much more interactable. Changing how the start and stop buttons look and give them a more welcoming feeling and also aligning the tiles to be in a four-by-four row and column would make everything less disorderly and neat. I would also try to add a high school concept so that users could see the highest score for the game.]
